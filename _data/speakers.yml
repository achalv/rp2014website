  abstract: "Early-stage companies revolve around the search for \'product-market fit\'  finding something people want. But once a need is found, the transition into hyper-growth happens alarmingly quickly, with little time to look back or course-correct. This talk will focus on technical operations deployment, availability, monitoring, and other ops-related topics in the face of 5% growth per week, all the way to billions of requests per day. We will focus particularly on (1) hardware platforms, including detailed performance benchmarks and analysis of financial cost, (2) deployment pipelines, (3) how to monitor ALL THE THINGS and (3) what matters early on, and what doesn't. Come hear it from the guy who wore the pager almost a year, and spent more than a few sleepless nights upgrading databases, fighting outages, and staring at ssh terminals, wondering whether the system would ever come back up..."

Garrett holds an M.S. in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis, where he currently resides with his wife, children, and beard."
  abstract: "Riot Games’s League of Legends supports millions of concurrent players at any given moment of the day. At that scale, tracking simple gameplay statistics results in the creation of terabytes of data that must be aggregated and presented to players. Scaling the system and developing additional features became difficult with Riot's initial stats system. To enable rapid iteration at scale, Riot built a new stats system to support features like the new Match History website. In this talk, I'll discuss in detail the backend architecture of the new stats system, the reasoning behind our technical choices for the system, and the challenges we faced building the system and scaling it to support the new Match History website."

  bio: "Roger has been an engineer at Bungie since graduating from UIUC in 2001. He has led the online services team since 2004\'s launch of a stats-tracking website for Halo 2, as it has grown to a full online-game engineering team of 25 people. They now create the software that lets Destiny support millions of players hitting servers that are responsible for mission and character state, mobile companion apps, and more. When time allows, he tries to incorporate features based on improbable past coursework such as ASTR 396 - Radio-interferometry."
  abstract: "Bungie's new game Destiny relies heavily on server-side features, a major engineering project following the Halo series and its light online requirements. This talk will discuss the planning, implementation, and lessons learned from launching a major always-online game. Hear how game design, in-house engineering specializations, the business case, and risk tolerance all came together to shape a plan to have the servers survive the game's release without becoming overwhelmed as so many games before have seen happen."

In his talk James Portnow will look at why we build games and why we care about them.  He will ask what more we can do with them and what it is about them that makes them effect us so much.  And, in the end, he will ask you to do more than simply build, he will ask you to create."
