  bio: "James Whittaker is an author, speaker, creative leader, and a Distinguished Technical Evangelist charged with showing Microsoft’s vision of the future to the world. His career spans academia, start-ups, and top tech companies. In 1986 he was the first computer science graduate hired by the FBI. His career continued—specializing in test automation—as a freelance developer, most notably for IBM, Ericsson, SAP, Cisco, and Microsoft. He then joined the faculty at the Florida Institute of Technology where he continued his prolific publication record in software testing and security. In 2002 his security work was spun off into a startup that was later acquired by Raytheon. His first stint at Microsoft was in Trustworthy Computing and Visual Studio. He then joined Google as an engineering director and led teams working on Chrome, Maps and Google+. In 2012, he rejoined Microsoft. Of his five books two have been Jolt Award finalists.

  bio: "Roger has been an engineer at Bungie since graduating from UIUC in 2001. He has led the online services team since 2004\'s launch of a stats-tracking website for Halo 2, as it has grown to a full online-game engineering team of 25 people. They now create the software that lets Destiny support millions of players hitting servers that are responsible for mission and character state, mobile companion apps, and more. When time allows, he tries to incorporate features based on improbable past coursework such as ASTR 396: Radio-interferometry."
