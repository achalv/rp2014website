abstract: Early-stage companies revolve around the search for 'product-market fit'  finding something people want. But once a need is found, the transition into hyper-growth happens alarmingly quickly, with little time to look back or course-correct. This talk will focus on technical operations deployment, availability, monitoring, and other ops-related topics in the face of 5% growth per week, all the way to billions of requests per day. We will focus particularly on (1) hardware platforms, including detailed performance benchmarks and analysis of financial cost, (2) deployment pipelines, (3) how to monitor ALL THE THINGS and (3) what matters early on, and what doesn't. Come hear it from the guy who wore the pager almost a year, and spent more than a few sleepless nights upgrading databases, fighting outages, and staring at ssh terminals, wondering whether the system would ever come back up...
