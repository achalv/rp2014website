abstract: Today, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has a Continued Examination backlog of 110,000 applications, up 500% since early 2010 years ago. The Patent Office grants over 70% of all applications, but that number jumps to almost 90% if you have the deep pockets and are willing to continually challenge rejections. But there is hope. Learn how predictive analytics can help improve equity, transparency, and predictability within the system. Big data can drive examiner behavior towards the desired mean, while leveling the playing field among all inventors and preserving America’s innovative spirit that has driven our economy for the past 100 years
